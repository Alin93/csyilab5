# Cloud Shape Your Idea Lab 5
The package contains supporting code for the Cloud Shape Your Idea course. It uses [Java 8](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk8/), [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) to create a simple web service that mimics the basic API provided by S3.
